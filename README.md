# About the repo

This repo was made from the CLI methods of 'create-react-app' and 'express-generator'. This means the skeleton and integration of App component was provided by React.

## Reasoning

I wanted to get experience creating components in React while developing responsive forms. While there may be mistakes, I learned a lot in the process about how to design React components and about general debugging.

## Future State

I want to eventually bring this set-up into our current MBSA web page and have members sign in through our website instead of through a Google Form. Then, the data could be automatically sent to a Google Sheets spreadsheet instead of a back-end database for now.
