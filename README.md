# About the Repo

This repo was made from the CLI methods of `'create-react-app'` and `'express-generator'`. This means the skeleton and integration of App component was provided by React.

## Reasoning

I wanted to get experience creating components in React while developing responsive forms. While there may be mistakes, I learned a lot in the process about how to design React components and about general debugging!

## How to find everything

The **'api'** folder is the Express backend and the **'client'** folder contains the front-end! I stored the React components within **client > src > components** and the container for the main form within **client > src > containers**.

## Future State!

I want to eventually bring this set-up into our current MBSA web page and have members sign in through our website instead of through a Google Form. Then, the data could be automatically sent to a Google Sheets spreadsheet instead of a back-end database for now.

### Thanks for stopping by!
